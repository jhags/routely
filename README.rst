Intro

Common operations and transformations on routes represented by a 2D line in xy space

Route is designed to provide many of the common route operations and transformations to make route processing simpler and quicker.

A route is represented by a series of point coordinates on a two dimensional x-y plane. Z-axis data can be specified as well, however the primary focus of these common transformations are based on the x-y plane data with z-axis data being transformed accordingly.

The primary focus is on x-y plane data because z-axis data does not have to represent a path through three dimensional space, rather z-data can represent additonal layers of route data that correspond to the x-y path.

For example, a runner may be tracking pace or heartrate, a car will have changes in speed, etc. Therefore, transformations are primarily concerned with the x-y route taken.

Installation
============

.. code-block:: python

    pip install routely


Quick start
===========

To begin with, let's define a path that comprises two lists of x and y points that together form the coordinates of the line.

.. code-block:: python

    # x and y coordinates of a path.
    x = [-5, 5, 15, 25, 20, 0]
    y = [0, 10, 40, 15, 5, 20]


To make use of Routely, we can pass these lists of x and y points to Routely's Route class.

.. code-block:: python

    from routely import Route

    r = Route(x, y)

    # Plot x vs y
    r.plotroute()

You can add z-axis data too, which should be passed as a dictionary. This enables you to have one or more z-axis datasets.

.. code-block:: python

    # Add a few z-axis datasets
    z1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    z2 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 0]

    # z-axis data must be passed as a dictionary
    z_data = {'foo':z1, 'bar':z2}

    r = Route(x, y, z=z_data)

    # Plot z-axis data
    # Note that z-axis data is plotted against the distance along the route
    r.plot_z()

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhags/routely/main/docs/images/plot_2.png

Using the Route object, you can now quickly and easily get key properties of the route data such as:

.. code-block:: python

    # Get the bounding box and center coordinates of the route
    r.bbox()
    ((-5, 0), (25, 40))

    r.center()
    (10.0, 20.0)

    # The absolute width, height and centerof the route
    r.width()
    30

    r.height()
    40
