Introduction
============

Route is designed to provide many of the common route operations and transformations to make route processing simpler and quicker.

A route is represented by a series of point coordinates on a two dimensional x-y plane. Z-axis data can be specified as well, however the primary focus of these common transformations are based on the x-y plane data with z-axis data being transformed accordingly.

The primary focus is on x-y plane data because z-axis data does not have to represent a path through three dimensional space, rather z-data can represent additonal layers of route data that correspond to the x-y path.

For example, a runner may be tracking pace or heartrate, a car will have changes in speed, etc. Therefore, transformations are primarily concerned with the x-y route taken.
